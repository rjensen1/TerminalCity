# Agriculture Buildings
# Farm buildings for agricultural operations (barn, silo, etc.)
#
# HOW TO USE:
# - Defines agricultural/industrial farm buildings (barn, silo, etc.)
# - These buildings are tied to FARMING OPERATIONS
# - Typically demolished or repurposed when farm is sold off
# - Note: Farmhouse is in residential.txt (can persist after farm ends)
# - Appearance at different zoom levels (display_char for 100ft, pattern_25ft for close zoom)
# - Referenced by farmstead plot templates using their 'id'
# - Can be placed as standalone buildings or as part of farmstead plots
#
# NOTE: This file is NOT currently parsed by the game.
# Building appearances are hardcoded in Program.cs GetFarmsteadStructureAppearance()
# The pattern_25ft fields are placeholders for future zoom-level detail system.
# See ZOOM_BUILDING_DETAIL.md for implementation plan.
