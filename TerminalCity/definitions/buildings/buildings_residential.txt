# Residential Buildings
# Buildings where people live - homes for families, individuals, etc.
#
# HOW TO USE:
# - Defines buildings whose PRIMARY purpose is housing people
# - Can appear in various contexts (farmsteads, suburbs, urban areas)
# - A farmhouse is RESIDENTIAL even when part of an active farm
# - When land use changes (farm → subdivision), these buildings can remain
# - Supports organic city evolution without bulldozing everything
#
# NOTE: This file is NOT currently parsed by the game.
# Building appearances are hardcoded in Program.cs GetFarmsteadStructureAppearance()
# The pattern_25ft fields are placeholders for future zoom-level detail system.
# See ZOOM_BUILDING_DETAIL.md for implementation plan.
