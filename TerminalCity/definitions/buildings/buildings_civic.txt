# Civic Buildings
# Public/community buildings not tied to farming or residential use.
# These are typically scenario-placed (not player-buildable in early eras).
#
# HOW TO USE:
# - Placed via [placed_buildings] section in scenario files
# - unlocked_by_default: false means players cannot build these directly
# - era_available / era_obsolete control which scenarios they appear in
