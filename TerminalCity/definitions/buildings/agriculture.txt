# Agriculture Buildings
# Farm buildings for rural and suburban development
#
# HOW TO USE:
# - Defines MAIN agricultural buildings (farmhouse, barn, silo, etc.)
# - These are PRIMARY structures that define the farmstead
# - Appearance at different zoom levels (display_char for 100ft, pattern_25ft for close zoom)
# - Referenced by farmstead plot templates using their 'id'
# - Can be placed as standalone buildings or as part of farmstead plots
#
# NOTE: This file is NOT currently parsed by the game.
# Building appearances are hardcoded in Program.cs GetFarmsteadStructureAppearance()
# The pattern_25ft fields are placeholders for future zoom-level detail system.
# See ZOOM_BUILDING_DETAIL.md for implementation plan.
