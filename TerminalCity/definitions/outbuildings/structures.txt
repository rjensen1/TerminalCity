# Farm Outbuildings and Structures
# Small accessory buildings for farms and homesteads
#
# HOW TO USE:
# - Defines SMALL outbuildings (shed, well, chicken coop, outhouse, etc.)
# - These are SECONDARY structures that support the main buildings
# - Can be placed as STANDALONE buildings in any plot
# - Can be included WITHIN farmstead plot templates (referenced in legend)
# - Generally smaller than main buildings (1x1 or 1x2 tiles)
# - Use 'can_attach_to' field to specify which buildings they complement
#
# NOTE: This file is NOT currently parsed by the game.
# Structure appearances are hardcoded in Program.cs GetFarmsteadStructureAppearance()
# Ready for future parser implementation.
