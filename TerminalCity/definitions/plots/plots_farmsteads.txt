# Farmstead Plots - Visual Map Format
# Uses legend system like roguelike room definitions
#
# HOW TO USE:
# - Defines the LAYOUT of farmstead curtilage plots (house, barn, yard, etc.)
# - Uses visual ASCII maps where each character represents a tile type
# - The legend maps characters to building/area types (H = farmhouse, . = yard)
# - These are TEMPLATES that get placed within farm plots during map generation
# - Plot file defines WHERE buildings go, building files define HOW they look
#
# ZOOM LEVEL: These maps represent 25ft zoom (maximum detail)
# - This is the "master layout" showing full tile footprint for each building
# - A 2x2 farmhouse occupies 4 tiles in the map (shown as HHHH)
# - At other zooms (100ft, 50ft), same tiles are blocked but render differently
# - Building definition files control visual appearance at each zoom level
