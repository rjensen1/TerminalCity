[description]
The neighboring city of Metropolis is bursting at the seams. Veterans returning from World War II need affordable housing, and this former farmland—just 20 minutes from downtown Metropolis—is the perfect location for a new suburban community. Your job is to transform these empty fields into a thriving residential town where families can pursue the American Dream.

[backstory]
The war is over, and America is booming. Young families are leaving crowded city apartments for homes with yards, garages, and the promise of a better life. Metropolis, once able to house everyone, now faces a housing crisis. Developers have their eyes on the flat farmland to the west—land that could become home to thousands. This is your chance to build something from scratch: a planned community that could become a model for suburban living across the nation.
